          The Community and the Built Environment indicator refers to perceived
          safety, access, and availability of facilities and spaces that provide
          opportunities for physical activity in children and young people.
          There is no specific recommendation for Community and the Built
          Environment, however researcher has reported a relationship between
          the built environment and physical activity

        </p>
        <p>
          The benchmarks used to grade this indicator are the percentage of
          children/parents satisfied with the play facilities available in their
          local area, as well as the percentage of children/parents living in a
          safe neighbourhood where they can be physically active.

        <p>
          For the 2016 Report Cards, the Research Work Group used the percentage
          of children/parents satisfied with the play facilities available in
          their local area to assign a grade to this indicator. Feedback from
          the largest consultation of its kind in Wales was also used to assist
          with the grading process. However, for the 2018 Report Card, the data
          available around these benchmarks were limited.

        <h1>Survey Data</h1>
        <p>
          The National Survey for Wales (2016/17) conducted 10,493 face-to-face
          interviews with one adult (aged 16+) in each household across Wales.
          From the previous 2014/15 round of interviews, the survey had adjusted
          questions around perceived safety, access, and availability of
          facilities and spaces that provide opportunities for physical activity
          in children and young people.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2014/15, the data found 54% and 38% of parents with a child aged
          1-10 and 11-15 years, respectively, were satisfied with the play
          facilities in their local area. Of the parents with a child aged 1-10
          years who were dissatisfied, 83% reported there was a lack of suitable
          outdoor public places for their child to play, whereas 64% reported a
          lack of suitable indoor spaces. Additionally, of the parents with a
          child aged 11-15 years who were dissatisfied, 77% cited a lack of
          suitable outdoor public places, 79% believed there was a lack of
          indoor public places, and 64% believed there were too few clubs or
          organised activities.
          <span className="bold">
            However, questions around this information was not included in the
            2015/16 round of interviews, therefore no new data was available.
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2016/2017, data was available on adults&apos; thoughts about their
          local area, but this was not specifically geared towards physical
          activity. The National Survey for Wales found that, when people are
          asked to think about their local area: 72% felt like they belong; 72%
          felt that people from different backgrounds get on well together; and
          73% felt that people treated each other with respect and
          consideration. All three of these percentages are lower than they were
          in 2014- 15.

              Commissioner for Wales, consultations with children and young
              people (aged 3-18+) in Wales, as well as, their parents, gave
              feedback on four key areas of focus linked to the United Nations
              Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC): Provision,
              Protection, Participation and Promotion. <br />

              Other common priorities for this age group were tackling poverty
              (29%), improving child safety (28%) and tackling bullying (28%).
              For children aged 7-11 years, stopping bullying was the highest
              priority (55%). The next two highest priorities for this age group
              were helping children and families in poverty (47%), and making
              local areas safer for children (41%). The most common priority
              (53%) for young people aged 11-18 was tackling bullying. More than
              40% of young people reported protecting children from violence and
              abuse at home, more facilities in the local area, and help for
              children and families in poverty as their highest priorities.
              Across all data reported, priorities did not vary substantially by
              age, gender or region for all age groups.
